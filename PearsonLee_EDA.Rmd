## Problem Definition (SMART)

Question: Do the means of the average of parent and children heights differ when parent and child differ by gender?

- Specific: Are the means of the averages of Parent/Child Heights equal?
- Measurable: We can the take means
- Achievable: Can compare values via t test
- Relevant: Useful for researchers looking at relationship between height and gender
- Time-Scaled: Multiple data sets exist, so question can be answered in a timely manner

## Initial Exploration (Variable Meanings)
A frequency data frame with 746 observations on the following 6 variables:

- Child: child height in inches, a numeric vector
- Parent: parent height in inches, a numeric vector
- Frequency: a numeric vector
- GP: a factor with levels fd fs md ms
- Par: a factor with levels Father Mother
- Chl: a factor with levels Daughter Son

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Get structure of PearsonLee for a high level view of the variables we are working with.
str(PearsonLee)
```

## Initial Exploration (Descriptive Statistics)
Initial summary of the PearsonLee dataset:

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Get summary of PearsonLee for high level view of the data we are analyzing.
summary(PearsonLee)
```

## Initial Exploration (Variance and SD) {.smaller}
Overview of how heights for child and parent disperse around each respective mean
```{r echo=TRUE}
# Take mean, variance, and standard deviation for variables of interest.
measures <- c(mean(child), var(child), sd(child), mean(parent),var(parent), sd(parent))
names(measures) <- c("Child Mean","Child Var", "Child SD", "Parent Mean", "Parent Var", "Parent SD")
measures
# Based on the results above we can see the measures for child and parent are relatively close. 
```

## Initial Exploration (Scatterplots)
Scatterplots of Child and Parent Heights by Gender

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Combined scatterplots of children and parent heights
# The purpose for doing this scatter plot was to initially look at the distribution between child and parent heights by gender. Also to check if the distribution of the data was a linear relationship or not.
require(lattice)
xyplot(child ~ parent|par+chl, data=PearsonLee)
```

## Initial Exploration (Histograms)
Histogram of Children Heights

```{r echo=FALSE}
# By making a histogram of our data distribution for children heights we can validate that the distribution is approximately normal or not.
# Include input for selection of bin numbers:
inputPanel(
  selectInput("n_breaks", label = "Number of bins:",
              choices = c(10, 20, 35, 50), selected = 20)
)

# Create histogram of children heights
renderPlot({h<-hist(child, probability = FALSE, breaks = as.numeric(input$n_breaks),
            xlab = "Children's Heights", main = "Histogram of Children's Heights", col="deepskyblue", plot = TRUE)
          })

```

## Initial Exploration (Histograms) {.smaller}
Histogram of Parent Heights 

```{r echo=FALSE}
# By making a histogram of our data distribution for parent heights we can validate that the distribution is approximately normal or not.
# Include input for selection of bin numbers:
inputPanel(
  selectInput("n_breaks", label = "Number of bins:",
              choices = c(10, 20, 35, 50), selected = 20)
)

# Create histogram of parent heights
renderPlot({hist(parent, probability = FALSE, breaks = as.numeric(input$n_breaks),
            xlab = "Parent's Heights", main = "Histogram of Parent's Heights", col="deepskyblue", plot = TRUE)

         })
# Both histograms look approximately normal.
```


## Initial Exploration (Boxplots)
Boxplot of Children and Parent Heights 
```{r echo=FALSE}
# After previously validating the distribution and relationship of the data we were able to dive deeper and look at the averages by gender for both child and parent as well as the spread of the data using box plots.
# Boxplot of children's heights by gender
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
boxplot(child~chl, data=PearsonLee, main="Boxplot of Children's Height",
xlab="Children", ylab="Children's Height", col=c('mistyrose','powderblue'))

# Boxplot of parent's heights by gender
boxplot(parent~par, data=PearsonLee, main="Boxplot of Parent's Height",
xlab="Parent", ylab="Parent's Height", col=c('powderblue','mistyrose'))
```

## Null and Alternative Hypotheses
<ul>
<li>Null Hypothesis: The means of the average heights for the 2 groups (same gender, different gender) are equal </li>
<li>Alternative Hypothesis: The means of the average heights for the 2 groups are <u>not</u> equal</li>
</ul>

## Results/Interpretations (t test)

```{r echo=FALSE}
layout(matrix(c(1,2,2,3), 2, 2, byrow = TRUE), heights=c(2,1))
# Take t test to test whether the means of the different groups are equal.
t.test(PearsonLee$avg~PearsonLee$group) 

# Boxplot of average of child and parent heights by group
boxplot(avg~group, data=PearsonLee, names=c("Same Gender", "Different Gender"),main="Boxplot of Average Heights by Group",
xlab="Group", ylab="Height", col = c('grey79','grey37'))

# After taking a t test, we were able to see that the means of the different groups are definitely not equal. Therefore, we can reject our null hypothesis and accept the alternative. 

#With the boxplot, we see that the means are not exactly the same, and further, we see there is a much greater spread with the "Same Gender" group.

# The means of the average of parent and children heights DO differ when parent and child differ by gender based on our analysis. 
```

## Conclusions and Next Steps
<p> Looking from the 95 percent confidence interval, a t value of -0.834 is p = 0.4.</p>
<p> We reject the null hypothesis at a <i>alpha = 0.05</i> level.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p align="center"><b><i>Statistically, the means of the two groups are not the same. However, from an objective point, a person would not be able to perceive the difference between a person of height 65.4 inches and another of height 65.65 inches.</b></i></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>For future next steps with this dataset it may be interesting if We consider further stratifying the data to look for differences among different height groups.</p>
